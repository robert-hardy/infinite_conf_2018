This repo contains a collection of scripts for an InfiniteConf2018 workshop,
held at CodeNode in July 2018.

There is a Trello board to accompany this: [https://trello.com/b/OsTPU8lh](https://trello.com/b/OsTPU8lh).

Much of the code is based on work done by Russell Jurney, that you can find in
[the repo](https://github.com/rjurney/Agile_Data_Code_2) for his excellent book [Agile Data Science 2.0](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Data-Science-2-0-Applications/dp/1491960116/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530858334&sr=8-1&keywords=agile+data+science).
